        ================================
            
            Installation
            ============
            
            .. code-block:: bash

            Getting Started
            ===============
            
            To interact with Atlantic.Net Cloud, you first need .. an Atlantic.Net Cloud account with 
            valid API keys.
            
            Keys can be set either as Env variables, or within the code.
                
            .. code-block:: bash
                
                # export ANET_PUBLIC_KEY='public_key'
                # export ANET_PRIVATE_KEY='private_key'
            
            .. code-block:: pycon
            
                >>> from anetpy.manager import AnetManager
                >>> anet = AnetManager('public_key', 'private_key')

        Methods
        =======

        The methods of the AnetManager are self explanatory; ex.
                
                .. code-block:: pycon
                
                    >>> anet.all_active_cloudservers()
                    >>> anet.show_cloudserver('12345')
                    >>> anet.destroy_cloudserver('12345')
                    >>> anet.all_regions()
                    >>> anet.all_images()
                    >>> anet.all_ssh_keys()
                    >>> anet.plans()
                    >>> anet.new_cloudserver('new_cloudserver', 66, 1601, 1)
